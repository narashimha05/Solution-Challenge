apart from that, let's talk about the build and design,
 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.549 align:start position:0%
apart from that, let's talk about the build and design,
look, <00:00:46.320><c>I </c><00:00:46.880><c>have </c><00:00:47.440><c>this</c>

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 align:start position:0%
look, I have this
 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.470 align:start position:0%
look, I have this
color <00:00:47.726><c>in </c><00:00:47.893><c>the </c><00:00:48.060><c>back </c><00:00:48.227><c>which </c><00:00:48.394><c>comes </c><00:00:48.561><c>with </c><00:00:48.728><c>a </c><00:00:48.895><c>slightly </c><00:00:49.062><c>metallic </c><00:00:49.229><c>finish, </c><00:00:49.396><c>it</c>

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
color in the back which comes with a slightly metallic finish, it
 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.189 align:start position:0%
color in the back which comes with a slightly metallic finish, it
gives <00:00:49.976><c>such </c><00:00:50.472><c>a </c><00:00:50.968><c>feel, </c><00:00:51.464><c>but </c><00:00:51.960><c>overall</c>

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
gives such a feel, but overall
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.349 align:start position:0%
gives such a feel, but overall
this <00:00:52.669><c>back </c><00:00:53.139><c>is </c><00:00:53.609><c>plastic, </c><00:00:54.079><c>it</c>

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
this back is plastic, it
 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.470 align:start position:0%
this back is plastic, it
looks <00:00:54.604><c>okay </c><00:00:54.849><c>to </c><00:00:55.094><c>me, </c><00:00:55.339><c>the </c><00:00:55.584><c>rest </c><00:00:55.829><c>can </c><00:00:56.074><c>be</c>

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
looks okay to me, the rest can be
 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.470 align:start position:0%
looks okay to me, the rest can be
your <00:00:56.748><c>choice, </c><00:00:57.016><c>you </c><00:00:57.284><c>may </c><00:00:57.552><c>like </c><00:00:57.820><c>it </c><00:00:58.088><c>in </c><00:00:58.356><c>appearance,</c>

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
your choice, you may like it in appearance,
 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.750 align:start position:0%
your choice, you may like it in appearance,
but <00:00:58.813><c>in </c><00:00:59.146><c>terms </c><00:00:59.479><c>of </c><00:00:59.812><c>in-hand </c><00:01:00.145><c>feel, </c><00:01:00.478><c>it</c>

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
but in terms of in-hand feel, it
 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.670 align:start position:0%
but in terms of in-hand feel, it
definitely <00:01:01.005><c>gives </c><00:01:01.250><c>a </c><00:01:01.495><c>little </c><00:01:01.740><c>plastic </c><00:01:01.985><c>feel.  </c><00:01:02.230><c>If </c><00:01:02.475><c>you</c>

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
definitely gives a little plastic feel.  If you
 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.350 align:start position:0%
definitely gives a little plastic feel.  If you
look <00:01:02.946><c>at </c><00:01:03.212><c>the </c><00:01:03.478><c>paper </c><00:01:03.744><c>weight, </c><00:01:04.010><c>it </c><00:01:04.276><c>is </c><00:01:04.542><c>around </c><00:01:04.808><c>192 </c><00:01:05.074><c>grams,</c>

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
look at the paper weight, it is around 192 grams,
 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.990 align:start position:0%
look at the paper weight, it is around 192 grams,
but <00:01:05.672><c>it </c><00:01:05.984><c>doesn't </c><00:01:06.296><c>feel </c><00:01:06.608><c>too </c><00:01:06.920><c>heavy</c>

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't feel too heavy
 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.789 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't feel too heavy
because <00:01:07.205><c>you </c><00:01:07.410><c>get </c><00:01:07.615><c>a </c><00:01:07.820><c>big </c><00:01:08.025><c>battery </c><00:01:08.230><c>with </c><00:01:08.435><c>it,</c>

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
because you get a big battery with it,
 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.789 align:start position:0%
because you get a big battery with it,
so <00:01:09.009><c>I </c><00:01:09.219><c>would </c><00:01:09.429><c>say </c><00:01:09.639><c>that </c><00:01:09.849><c>the </c><00:01:10.059><c>weight </c><00:01:10.269><c>balance </c><00:01:10.479><c>is</c>

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
so I would say that the weight balance is
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.190 align:start position:0%
so I would say that the weight balance is
overall <00:01:11.069><c>good </c><00:01:11.339><c>here, </c><00:01:11.609><c>but </c><00:01:11.879><c>do </c><00:01:12.149><c>remember </c><00:01:12.419><c>that </c><00:01:12.689><c>it </c><00:01:12.959><c>is</c>

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
overall good here, but do remember that it is
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.469 align:start position:0%
overall good here, but do remember that it is
definitely <00:01:13.546><c>a </c><00:01:13.892><c>big </c><00:01:14.238><c>and </c><00:01:14.584><c>wide </c><00:01:14.930><c>phone, </c><00:01:15.276><c>if</c>

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
definitely a big and wide phone, if
 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.670 align:start position:0%
definitely a big and wide phone, if
you <00:01:15.632><c>have </c><00:01:15.785><c>small </c><00:01:15.938><c>hands, </c><00:01:16.091><c>then </c><00:01:16.244><c>you </c><00:01:16.397><c>may </c><00:01:16.550><c>definitely </c><00:01:16.703><c>find </c><00:01:16.856><c>it </c><00:01:17.009><c>big </c><00:01:17.162><c>and </c><00:01:17.315><c>heavy</c>

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
you have small hands, then you may definitely find it big and heavy
 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.870 align:start position:0%
you have small hands, then you may definitely find it big and heavy
and <00:01:18.620><c>there </c><00:01:19.560><c>is</c>

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
and there is
 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.510 align:start position:0%

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
a bit of gloss around the camera model, so
 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.429 align:start position:0%
a bit of gloss around the camera model, so

its biggest effect is on the battery.
